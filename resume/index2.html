				<b>Software Engineer</b> - Earfl Inc. (11/2007-8/2008). While at earfl, I worked with a small team to develop a web-based audio platform and social hub. We built a suite of content creation tools mixing in services from EC2, S3, flickr, google maps, and youtube. We provided a RESTful API and a ruby gem that allowed developers to quickly add dynamic audio content on their site. Much of our site was designed using javascript widgets that used our API as a data-service layer. We also offered traditional dial-in support and phone number provisioning to enable crowdsourced content collection.

				<b>Developer / PM</b> - Invision Design and Development Group (3/2007-10/2007). At InvisionDDG's office in Sacramento I produced project estimates (bids), met with clients, defined project timelines, and wrote a lot of code. We focused on building community and/or service oriented web applications for clients using Ruby on Rails, Django, and trac.
			</li>

				<b>Lead Developer / Site Architect</b> - at Leading Resources Inc. in Sacramento, CA (6/2005-1/2007).  My work at LRI involved leading a small team of web developers.

				<b>Student Intern</b> - at Agilent Technologies in Folsom, CA (7/2004-9/2004). This internship allowed me to work as a part of the two-person team which developed the drivers for Agilent's new 6890N series Gas Chromatograph machine. These drivers, written using LabVIEW, enable arrays of Gas Chromatograph machines to be automated, including their injection sequences.

				<b>Software Developer</b> - at S.A.I. in El Dorado Hills (8/2003-1/2004). This position required a meticulous understanding of Linux and SCO systems programming in conjunction with telecommunications terminology and PBX call record output specifications. I worked on extremely large sed scripts, and helped design a solid state network monitoring device with embedded Linux.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Linux Developer</b> - for UCDAVIS Lab Management (11/1999-7/2000). The UCD Linux Development Project was created to port the university's computer lab services from HPUX to less expensive hardware running Linux.  Legacy code designed to monitor and improve network functionality for the labs and classrooms was ported from C to Perl.
